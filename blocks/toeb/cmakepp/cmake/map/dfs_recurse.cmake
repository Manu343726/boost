#  enter: (node)->void # called before successors are evaluated
#  leave: (node)->void # called after node's successors were evaluated
# }
# expand has the following available vars
# - ${path} contains path to the current node (including current node)
# - ${parent} contains the node from which current node was called
# enter has the following available vars
# - all expand vars
# - ${successors} contains all direct successors of current node
# - ${enter} (boolish) can be checked to see if currently entering a node (if enter and leave callbacks are the same function)
# leave has the following available vars
# - all expand vars
# - ${successors} same as enter
# - ${leave} (boolish) can be checked to see if node is currently being left (if enter and leave callbacks are the same function)
# - ${visited} contains all nodes which were visited in recursive calls below current node
#    visited may contain duplicates depending on the graph
